The need for a single but dynamic end goal has driven game designers to incorporate an abstract score mechanic into their games for decades.

But in reality what kind of real game represents the skill level of its players as a single value? There is a difference though between multiple stats which are woven into a final result; but often these still fall into the trap of being a "score" or a "rank".

Imagine instead if we could have a less abstract scoring system. As we know games benefit in other ways from not abstracting concepts, for instance; not showing a health bar and instead, negatively impacting play. (i.e making the screen go red)

For instance if you were making an infinite runner (note that if you were making an arcade game, it would be completely valid to have a score) we could label your "score" a "distance" instead.

In the case of Chrome's Dino game the "score" has no label at all, and this leaves determining the meaning of the "score" up to the player.

Well, that's just what I think and honestly I have labelled or implied things as scores in my games anyway, so just do what works well in your game and don't follow cliches if they don't fit your game,
