    <p>The need for a single but dynamic end goal has driven game designers to incorporate an abstract score mechanic into their games for decades.</p>

<p>But in reality what kind of real game represents the skill level of its players as a single value? There is a difference though between multiple stats which are woven into a final result; but often these still fall into the trap of being a &ldquo;score&rdquo; or a &ldquo;rank&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Imagine instead if we could have a less abstract scoring system. As we know games benefit in other ways from not abstracting concepts, for instance; not showing a health bar and instead, negatively impacting play. (i.e making the screen go red)</p>

<p>For instance if you were making an infinite runner (note that if you were making an arcade game, it would be completely valid to have a score) we could label your &ldquo;score&rdquo; a &ldquo;distance&rdquo; instead.</p>

<p>In the case of Chrome&rsquo;s Dino game the &ldquo;score&rdquo; has no label at all, and this leaves determining the meaning of the &ldquo;score&rdquo; up to the player.</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s just what I think and honestly I have labelled or implied things as scores in my games anyway, so just do what works well in your game and don&rsquo;t follow cliches if they don&rsquo;t fit your game,</p>
