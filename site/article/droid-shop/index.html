    <p><em>I recently started releasing apps on the play store after a long time of only using itch.io for android releases.</em></p>

<p>Android is great for people getting into app development but their distribution platforms dont have quite the reach or popularity as IOS.</p>

<p>What android does well is allow for the quick, easy and relatively cheap submission of apps to its App Store; the Play Store, and while this creates an environment filled with crappy games and money making schemes remiscent of a million dollar homepage, it also provides a space for new app developers to quickly get started. As a new developer on android however i have noticed that, due to the high amount of game submissions, my game gets little attention outside of those who find out about it through my social media. Itch.io &amp; Steam however both provide a place which quickly shows off new releases which helps to get a couple of people looking at your app</p>

<p>I also get many many more views than downloads as compared to itch.io. I reckon this is due to the amount of effort required to install them and the average quality produced by doing so. You can only download so many shit games before you start being a bit careful with your time and internet access.</p>
